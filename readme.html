<h1>project oop</h1>
<p>

</p>
<p>
This is the project for exercising the lecture *object-oriented programming*.
The project is a code base in the Java programming language and
contains several basic classes as example programs of OOP.
Those classes are declared in files located in the subdirectory `src/main/java/`.

</p>
<p>
To build the code of the project,
you will needs to execute the following command after
installing [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org).

</p>
<p>
mvn package

</p>
<p>
The command will produce the `oop-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file in the `target` directory,
which contains compiled code of the classes.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
For example, you can execute program with the jar, like the following command

</p>
<p>
    java -cp target/oop-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar oop.nonmod.markdown.NonModMarkdown readme.md readme.html

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
This will execute the class from the file `src/main/java/oop/markdown/nonmod/Markdown.java`
and takes 2 arguments `readme.md` and `readme.html`.
The `Markdown` class reads the file specified as the first argument
and converts it to the file specified as the second argument.

</p>
<p>
The project currently contains the following programs

</p>
<ul>
<li>`oop.drawing.*` : drawing figure apps</li>
<li>`oop.markdown.*`: simplified markdown processor</li>
<li>`oop.sprite.*`  : tiny sprite example</li>
<li>`oop.stack.*`   : stack example</li>
</ul>
